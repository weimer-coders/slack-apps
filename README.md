## [Build your first Slack Bot in Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html)

## [Giant list of walk-throughs](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/)
This is a giant list of walk-throughs for Python, Node and (one) Ruby script. It's a good place to find ideas on what you can build, and it's also a good resource to see how others write their code in different languages.
