In order to make a Slack App or Bot, you need to register for a user_id and an access_token. This [article](https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-build-your-own-slack-app-and-bot/) explains it really well. In terms of explaining a sample python script, [this](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) isn't the clearest explanation, but it's good sample code to mess with.
Wait, giant list of walk-throughs for Python, Node and Ruby. [Link](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/).

[Building Slack apps from Slack](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps)

* Here is Slack’s overview for building Slack apps. I think it is useful because it is Slack itself explaining Slack apps to you.

[App directory](https://slack.com/apps/category/At0EFWTR6D-featured)

* Here is the Slack app directory, which can be useful for us when we consider what kind of app we want to create so that way it is a new, fresh idea that someone hasn’t already created.

[App examples](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-apps-integrations)

* This blog post gives examples of 15 different Slack apps, and I think it offers a wide variety for what we can do. Some are outright helpful for a newsroom, such as pooling together people’s contacts, and some are more fun, such as adding the gifs to conversations. So I think this gives a good, general overview of some ideas we might have. 

[Slack bots](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-build-chat-bot/)

* This article is nice because it not only discusses how to build a Slack bot, but it discusses what a bot is (although we probably already understand that) and what types of bots you can make. So it gives us an overview of every part of the process we need.

[Slack App or Bot User Integration](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8)

* This is a review of what we went over in class that goes over the difference between an app and a bot.
