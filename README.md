In order to make a Slack App or Bot, you need to register for a user_id and an access_token. This [article](https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-build-your-own-slack-app-and-bot/) explains it really well. In terms of explaining a sample python script, [this](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) isn't the clearest explanation, but it's good sample code to mess with.
Wait, giant list of walk-throughs for Python, Node and Ruby. [Link](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/).
