#### Tools and Documentation

* [python-slackclient | GitHub](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient): As the name suggests this is a python client that allow you to make Slack bots and apps (slaps?) with Slack’s API. There are several other python clients, but this one comes from Slack itself. 
* [Slack API Documentation | Slack](https://api.slack.com/): Slack’s documentation for their API.
* [Building Slack apps | Slack](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps): This guide from Slack is light on code but goes in depth into the process of actually setting up a Slack app that can be used by others. They also have a whole page dedicated to [best practices](https://api.slack.com/best-practices) when making Slack apps. 

#### Tutorials and Examples

* [How To Write a Slack Bot — with Python Code Examples | Julian Martinez](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/how-to-write-a-slack-bot-with-python-code-examples-4ed354407b98): This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up a Slack bot using Python. 
* [How to Deploy Your Slack Bots to Heroku | Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku): This is tutorial from Heroku walks you through deploying a Slack bot to Heroku. The process is familiar to anyone who deployed their Twitter bots to Heroku.

### Caitlin
In order to make a Slack App or Bot, you need to register for a user_id and an access_token. This [article](https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-build-your-own-slack-app-and-bot/) explains it really well. In terms of explaining a sample python script, [this](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) isn't the clearest explanation, but it's good sample code to mess with.
Wait, giant list of walk-throughs for Python, Node and Ruby. [Link](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/slackbots/).

[Building Slack apps from Slack](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps)

* Here is Slack’s overview for building Slack apps. I think it is useful because it is Slack itself explaining Slack apps to you.

[App directory](https://slack.com/apps/category/At0EFWTR6D-featured)

* Here is the Slack app directory, which can be useful for us when we consider what kind of app we want to create so that way it is a new, fresh idea that someone hasn’t already created.

[App examples](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-apps-integrations)

* This blog post gives examples of 15 different Slack apps, and I think it offers a wide variety for what we can do. Some are outright helpful for a newsroom, such as pooling together people’s contacts, and some are more fun, such as adding the gifs to conversations. So I think this gives a good, general overview of some ideas we might have. 

[Slack bots](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-build-chat-bot/)

* This article is nice because it not only discusses how to build a Slack bot, but it discusses what a bot is (although we probably already understand that) and what types of bots you can make. So it gives us an overview of every part of the process we need.

[Slack App or Bot User Integration](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8)

* This is a review of what we went over in class that goes over the difference between an app and a bot.
